h3. Style

Style, written by Jack Kinsella ("blog":http://www.jackkinsella.ie), helps you improve your English language writing. Based on stylistic advice given by the likes of Stunck & White, Bill Bryson, and Geroge Orwell, style scans your text and markup files, (e.g. html and textile files), then prints out a list of issues found within your text. Currently the issues spotted include:

* Usage of 11 different forms of passive tense.
 The letter was sent
* Broken Links
http://www.thiswebsite404s.com
* Ugly words
The government utilized the resources.
* Speaking in generalities
Many people think that
* Useless words
It was a very fast app.
* Repeating the same non structural word within a sentence
Trask makes an excellent point, forcefully and with taste, in his excellent work 'Mind The Gaffe'
* Using latin abbreviations within your text
E.g.
* Spelling mistakes
addd
* Repeating the same word consecutively 
We went to the the shopping centre.
* Excess white space
We went   to the shopping centre.

Please note that linguistic analysis is a hard problem, so you cannot expect perfect results. Think of style as guidelines to steer you in the righ t direction.
