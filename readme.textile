h1. Style

Style, written by Jack Kinsella ("blog":http://www.jackkinsella.ie), helps you improve your English language writing. Based on stylistic advice given by authors such as Skunk & White, Bill Bryson and Geroge Orwell, Style scans your text and markup files then lists issues found. Currently it spots the following problems:

* *Usage of 11 different forms of passive tense.*
 The letter was sent
* *Broken links*
http://www.thiswebsite404s.com
* *Ugly words*
The government utilized the resources.
* *Speaking in generalities*
Many people think that
* *Useless words*
It was a very fast app.
* *Repeating the same non structural word within a sentence*
Trask makes an excellent point, forcefully and with taste, in his excellent work 'Mind The Gaffe'
* *Using latin abbreviations within your text*
E.g.
* *Spelling mistakes*
addd
* *Repeating the same word consecutively* 
We went to the the shopping centre.
* *Excess white space*
We went   to the shopping centre.

_Linguistic analysis is a hard problem, so you cannot expect perfect results. Think of Style as guidelines to steer you in the right direction._
