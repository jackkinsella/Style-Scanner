h1. Style

Style, written by Jack Kinsella ("blog":http://www.jackkinsella.ie), helps you improve your English language writing. Based on stylistic advice given by authors such as Skunk and White, Bill Bryson and George Orwell, Style scans your text and markup files then lists issues found. Currently it spots the following problems:

* *Use of 600 different clich√©s*
  He pushed the envelope
* *Use of 11 different forms of passive tense.*
 The letter was sent
* *Broken links*
http://www.thiswebsite404s.com
* *Ugly words*
The government utilized the resources.
* *Speaking in generalities*
Many people think that
* *Useless words*
It was a very fast app.
* *Repeating the same non structural word within a sentence*
Trask makes an excellent point, forcefully and with taste, in his excellent work 'Mind The Gaffe'
* *Using latin abbreviations within your text*
E.g.
* *Spelling mistakes*
addd
* *Repeating the same word consecutively* 
We went to the the shopping centre.
* *Excess white space*
We went   to the shopping centre.

_Linguistic analysis is a hard problem, so you cannot expect perfect results. Think of Style as guidelines to steer you in the right direction._
