Making a cliché scanner is easier said than done. The devil is really in the details. 

Today Rob Dooley and I worked balls to the ball to wall to build software that could catch clichés in all their shapes and forms. In many ways it was a real baptism of fire, but we pulled through in the end.

It goes without saying that hard work pays off, and I think that this
software could be a real game changer.

So get on the bandwagon, and improve your writing by leaps and bounds
with my brand new style scanner soon to be released under an MIT license.
