Making a cliché scanner is easier said than done. The devil is really in the details. 

Today Rob Dooley and I worked balls to the balls to the wall to build software that could catch clichés in all their shapes and forms. In many ways it was a real baptism of fire, but we pulled through in the end.

It goes without saying that hard work pays off, and that this software
pushes the envelope.

So get get on the bandwagon, and improve your writing by leaps and
bounds by utilizing my brand new style scanner, soon to be released under an MIT license.
