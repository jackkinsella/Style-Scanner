The duke is a gonzo journalist sent to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas alongside his Samoan Attorney "Dr. Gonzo". They rent out a red convertible "the red shark" and fill a suitcase with drugs. They barely cover the race partly due to the amount of dust and partly due to how drugged up they are. A binge ensues, and fun includes trashing the hotel room, parking on footpaths, scaring people publically with knives (and trying to cover each other up) and Dr. Gonzo sitting in a bath demanding an electric radio.
